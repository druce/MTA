    "# The modern data stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want a dashboard that is automatically kept up to date when new data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, every January 1, I have some notebooks and blog posts I should update with 2022 data, although I usually don't. It would be nice to have that all happen automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need ~6 things to run data pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A scheduler / orchestrator to check for new data and trigger jobs when data is available: maybe on a schedule, maybe monitoring a local directory, maybe polling a remote directory, maybe receiving emails or other signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tools to manage dependency graphs ([DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) to trigger jobs / notifications downstream when jobs succeed or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tools to fetch data from APIs, CSVs etc via standard protocols. Built-in taps for e.g. Zoom or Salesforce would be nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tools to munge data, extract, load, and transform (ELT). Earlier OLAP manifestations processed data into cubes, sort of like spreadsheets within a database, to batch pre-process aggregations and enable real-time drilldowns. Modern data stacks keep data in close to raw form and leverage parallel processing to transform on the fly. In the extreme, we can make a cluster and move a shard of the data to each node in the cluster, moving the data close to the compute and keeping it in RAM. Then each node can do its part of an aggregations and drilldowns and send the results to a controller for final compilations. Thus ELT in contrast to old-school ETL.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data storage to manage the data and let us query it and aggregate it: DBMS, data warehouse, data lake, lakehouse etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Front end frameworks to create dataviz, reports, dashboards and end-user apps\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be simpler to break down into ELT, data warehouse, BI/front end. In practice 1, 2, and 3 can overlap but there are usually multiple products. There are also [additional pieces](https://i.redd.it/pdnuk1r0yjf71.jpg), like monitoring pipelines in production, data quality, data governance. You can go [pretty deep](https://mattturck.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-MAD-Landscape-v3.pdf). But this is a reasonable starting framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll try to build a basic modern data stackwith MTA turnstile data to do something like this: https://toddwschneider.com/dashboards/nyc-subway-turnstiles/ using [MTA source data](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Turnstile-Usage-Data-2020/py8k-a8wg).\n",
    "\n",
    "one approach is an enterpries-ish 'on-prem' approach, although probably in ECS\n",
    "- spin up spark cluster\n",
    "- airflow to manage getting data in , tools like Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte to help with ELT\n",
    "- django to deliver some apps\n",
    "\n",
    "another approach is 'cloud-native', using pay-as-you-go SaaS cloud services\n",
    "- Snowflake (or Redshift)\n",
    "- cloud service like prefect, dagster, astronomer \n",
    "- cloud analytics service, Tableau Cloud, PowerBI SaaS\n",
    "\n",
    "but I'm not going to do any of those, just want a lightweight version to run on my MacBook. Tech we will leverage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duckdb https://duckdb.org/ . DuckDB is SQLlite for column-oriented data. In other words it's a lightweight library that does high-performance aggregation using SQL. why columnar databases are faster - https://loonytek.com/2017/05/04/why-analytic-workloads-are-faster-on-columnar-databases/ . For instance, we can usually get orders of magnitude improvement in size/speed using a columnar format like Parquet vs. CSV with binary storage and compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Singer https://www.singer.io/ . open source project from Stitch, allows one to build 'taps' that abstract talking to specific data sources, like CSVs, or Salesforce, or Zoom, or Postgres. So in theory, with a config file, you can say, grab data from CSV, load it into your Postgres DB.\n",

    "- meltano - a CLI library that uses Singer taps to move data\n",

    "this dude has a post-modern data stack: https://blog.devgenius.io/modern-data-stack-demo-5d75dcdfba50\n",
    "\n",
    "footnote: part of me feels like, a relational database has one job, provide a solid performant abstraction to tabular data. It's weird and annoying to have to use different database engines for column-oriented vs row-oriented. SQL Server has had COLUMNSTORE for 10 years. Maybe that will be the way to go, traditional RDBMS's will incorporate better column-oriented functionality and keep all the good stuff like transactions and query optimization. Or maybe everyone will have to query a [plethora of database engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) and data lakes and we'll need a SQL layer on top over them all. Possibly that's the niche that tools like [Trino](https://trino.io/) are looking to fill. Data seems like the mother of all leaky abstractions, you don't get good performance if you don't know a fair amount about what's going on under the hood. DBAs and data engineers are maybe not going away. Or maybe it's so hard that a lot of people will just put the data into managed cloud services optimized for their use case."
